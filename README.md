## HOW-TO
1. Place the class '.parallax' on any element meant to have the parallax effect.
2. Add a defining class such as '.plx-100-y', where 'plx-' is the identifier, '100' is the animation length in pixels, and 'y' is the transform direction - can be either 'y', 'x', or 'z'. If using 'z', don't forget to add perspective to the parent.
3. If value should be inverted, add class of 'inv'
